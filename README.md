# VGA-Passthrough
Notes and launcher scripts used to configure VGA Passthrough with Linux Mint 18.2 - xenial 16.04

Coming soon...notes

Todo:
- Edit scripts to allow more RAM for VM, 32gb currently is fine but I can give it more. Hugepages might need to be reconfigured
- Convert bash_history to a script and add to my normal machine configuration
- Benchmarking - MORE
- Test Windows 7 - Benchmark
- Install PCI-E audio card, pass it through to VM.
