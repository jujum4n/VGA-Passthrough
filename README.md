# VGA-Passthrough
Notes and launcher scripts used to configure VGA Passthrough with Xubuntu 16.0.4

Coming soon...notes

Todo:
- Edit scripts to allow more RAM for VM, 32gb currently is fine but I can give it more. Hugepages might need to be reconfigured
- Convert bash_history to a script and add to my normal machine configuration
- Get better audio working with Windos 10 VM
- Benchmarking
- Reformat OS so 1TB SSD is used for Guest and 500GB SSD is for host
- Test Windows 7 - Benchmark
